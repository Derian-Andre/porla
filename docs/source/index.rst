Porla documentation
===================

Overview
--------

Porla is a programmable BitTorrent client. It is distributed as an NPM package
(`porla`) and a starting point can be generated with the official Yeoman
generator (`yo porla`).

Porla is perfectly suitable for headless setups, such as seedboxes, software
distribution servers, etc.

.. note:: Some Node.js knowledge is required to set up a Porla instance.
